# Scripts

## First important work is sum all workflow and get a gold standard!

- [**dataget_scRNAseq**](dataget_scRNAseq): Perform quality control of single-cell RNA-seq data using SoupX and Scrublet.
- [**DEA-Seurat**](DEA-Seurat): Conduct differential expression analysis with three Seurat functions to identify gene sets.
- [**enrich_scRNAseq**](enrich_scRNAseq): Analyze the biological functions of identified genes (e.g., GO and KEGG enrichment).
- [**Ortho_gene**](Ortho_gene): Compare datasets between two groups to identify orthologous relationships (e.g., using BLASTP).
- [**GRN-pySCENIC**](GRN-pySCENIC): Construct gene regulatory networks with pySCENIC.
- [**cell_similarity**](cell_similarity): Calculate and visualize similarity across multiple groups using Jaccard and MetaNeighbor.
